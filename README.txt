# HackerRank_code

This is a repository of all the code I've written for questions seen on Hackerrank as of 01/24/2017.

Practice problems reside in practice and competition problems reside in competitions. Each file, generally, tries to solve a single problem. Some might store common needed tools such as sorting methods, data structure implementations, etc. If the the file is a solution to a question the then the question's source is a comment on the top of the file. Also, most likely, the name of the file will be similar to the title of the problem. Any code that isn't mine is cited with the source in a comment. I do not take any credit for any code I did not write.

The goal is to grow this repository, thus expanding  my coding tool bank when I'm approaching real world problems. 

(As a result don't expect much when it comes to coding style and coding standards. This repository really just tracks how much algorithms and data structures I'm learning and how much volume I'm putting into this craft.)

Some personal goals I'd like to hit:
	Understand DP in and out (created 1/31/2017)
	Understand graph traversing algorithms (created 1/31/2017)
	Reach a competitive rating of 2000+ (created 1/31/2017)
	
	Write tons of code =)
